Go CLI App to get weather forecasts

# Notes

Multiple Locations: Allow users to specify multiple locations and retrieve weather forecasts for each location separately. This could be useful for users who frequently travel or have interests in multiple places.

Interactive Mode: Implement an interactive mode where users can navigate through different options using a menu-based interface. This can improve user experience by providing a more intuitive way to interact with the tool.

Customizable Output: Provide options for users to customize the output format of weather forecasts. For example, allow users to choose between displaying weather information in text format, JSON format, or as a graphical representation.

Weather Alerts: Integrate weather alert notifications to inform users about severe weather conditions such as storms, hurricanes, or extreme temperatures. Users can subscribe to receive alerts for specific locations.

Historical Data: Extend the tool to fetch historical weather data for a specified location. Users can retrieve past weather conditions for analysis or reference purposes.

Geolocation Support: Implement geolocation support to automatically detect the user's current location and provide weather forecasts without requiring users to input location coordinates manually.

Forecast Comparison: Enable users to compare weather forecasts between different locations or time periods. This feature can be useful for planning trips or comparing weather patterns between cities.

Weather Map: Integrate a weather map feature that visualizes weather conditions using interactive maps. Users can view temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other weather parameters overlaid on a map.

Integration with Calendar: Allow users to add weather forecasts directly to their calendar applications. This feature can help users plan their activities more efficiently by syncing weather information with their schedules.

Voice Assistant Integration: Integrate with voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to provide weather forecasts via voice commands. Users can ask questions like "What's the weather like in New York City today?" and receive spoken responses.
